Should begin inside the UDP folder
Inside UDP Folder: 
	folders: clientSide, serverSide
	JPEG: 	foo2, foo3
	Text:	foo1

Beginning with the serverSide directory
	compile uftp_server.c with: make server
	follow with ./server <portno>
		ie: ./server 5000
clientSide directory
	compile uftp_client.c with: make client
	follow with ./client <ip addr> <portno>
		ie: ./client 192.168.0.35 5000
	#The ipAddr should be the ip addr of the server
From there all the client will be prompted with a display 
screen featuring all of the functions implemented.

These functions include:
	get [file_name]
	put [file_name]
	delete [file_name]
	ls
	exit

The server will need to be running for these actions to take place
files foo2 and foo3 are good for both the get/put functions, but
foo1 is too large (22kb) and the writeup recommended transfer of 
2-5kb files. In order to transfer a file of that size the MAXBUFSIZE
would need to be changed.
